The Piranah Brothers:

  On Ethel the Frog tonight we look at violence: the violence of
  British Gangland. Last Tuesday a reign of terror was ended when
  the notorious Piranha Brothers, Dug and Dinsdale — after one
  the of most extraordinary trials in British legal history —
  were sentenced to 400 years imprisonment for crimes of
  violence.
